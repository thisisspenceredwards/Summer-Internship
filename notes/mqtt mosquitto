	sudo apt update
	sudo apt upgrade
	
	sudo apt install mosquitto
	sudo apt install mosquitto-clients

To run mosquitto at boot up as a service:
	sudo systemctl enable mosquitto.service

To run mosquitto in background as a daemon add -d option
	mosquitto -d 

To test installation
	mosquitto -v

	Message Error Address already in use means mosquitto is running

	mosquitto_sub -t testTopic
	mosquitto_pub -t testTopic -m "Hello world!"

Show all running processes with "mos" in name
	ps aux | grep mos

Kill process use PID from previous
	sudo kill -s SIGINT <PID> 


By default, installing mosquitto starts it as a service.  To start & stop a service:
	sudo service stop mosquitto
	sudo service start mosquitto
