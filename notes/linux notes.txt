Used startx.  Opened new shell with login.  Unable to login.  Had to change 
permissions of shell using:

Ctrl+Alt+F2 to get to a text-console with a login prompt. Log in.  Default
user is "pi" with password "raspberry".

At command prompt, enter 

	sudo chown pi:pi ~/.Xauthority
	touch .~/.Xauthority
	sudo reboot
